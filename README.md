 Assisted Distributed Kernel is a peer to peer networked solution for cloud computing
The existing system utilized in cloud computing is centered around proprietary servers that are set up to host cloud services. 
These ‘data centers’ serve as an expensive and restricting resource that is constantly in need of high and redundant power for 
cooling systems and assured availability. In addition to this, it has been noted that there are billions of underutilized Personal 
computers that are capable of providing a vast consolidation of computation and storage capacities. The proposed model aims to
tackle this situation by gaining permitted access to these underutilized resources and creating a virtual environment that 
functions on said availability.The virtual machine is designed to work on the basic idea of a decentralized server, 
where the accessible resources are distributed among requesting users on the basis of individual needs. The users are 
interconnected to stimulate a peer to peer architecture that also makes shared resource identification and utilization hassle free 
over the proposed platform. He/she can choose to leave or withdraw the shared resources from the platform at any time.
